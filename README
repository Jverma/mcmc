Python implementation of Markov Chain Monte - Carlo. The algorithm used is the Metropolis-Hastings and we tried to fit straight line through the data points which is a collection of (x,y) values.

To run : 
python fitness.py data_file.txt

Change the fitness function (in mcmc.py) according to the data and run the script to get the results.
